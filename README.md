## 🎯 What Makes Me Different

**The Business-Minded Developer**  
30 years coding + 15 years as business consultant = I architect systems that make sense to both CTOs and CFOs. When I suggest a refactor, it comes with a business case.

**Legacy-to-Modern Bridge**  
Started with COBOL on 8-bit machines, now building cloud-native multi-tenant SaaS. This journey taught me what actually works when millions depend on your code.

**SQL as a Native Language**  
While most developers write queries that crash production, I optimize databases that process millions of transactions. Three decades of SQL isn't just experience — it's instinct.

## 🤖 Modern Development Approach

**AI-Enhanced Workflows**  
Integrating AI tools throughout the development lifecycle — code generation, automated reviews, intelligent testing, and documentation. 30 years of experience + AI acceleration = delivery speed that surprises even me.

**Pragmatism Over Purism**  
Perfect code that ships next year loses to working code that ships today. The best architecture is the one that solves real problems and adapts to change.
